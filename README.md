Google Drive Downloader written in python using Tcl/Tk

This is a simple python program that can download files from Google Driven when given a download link.
Simply copy and paste the download link into the program and then select which folder the contents should be placed into.

Right now only .rar files work and will extract the contents into the folder and then delete the .rar file.

TODO:
Make the program content aware so that any type of file you download will be handled correctly and if it is a compressed format,
ask the user if extraction should happen or not.
